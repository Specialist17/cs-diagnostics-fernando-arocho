Explain everything that happens from the moment you type in a web address
to the when the website appears in front of the user.

Step 1: User types in address and the client sends the information through an a Request.
This request will have headers that contain the type of information the user is requesting.
It could be that the user is requesting to GET an image or to tell the server that the user wants
to POST something to a database.

If it's a secure network, it will connect to the server through HTTPS, meaning there's an SSL
certificate in that server.

After the server receives the request, it disconnects from the client while it looks for the
information that was requested. After it finishes, it sends back the information in a response.
This response contains the headers that tell the client the type of response it got.
It can have information like if the file was an image, a html file, etc.

I believe that the requests are sent in a series of data packets, like small boxes of information
that have a sender and an address for the receiver.

Not sure what DNS does and don't remember what TCP was
